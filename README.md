### AI is the new Electricity

​	AI is the new electricity. Started about 100 years ago, the electrifacation of our society transformed ever major industry, evertingthing ranging from transportation, manufacturing, healthcare,communications, and many more.And I thinked wo see a new surprisingly clear power of AI to bring aabout an equally big transformation.And of course, the part of the AI, that is rising rapidly driving along with these developments is deep learling.

​	Today, deep learning is one of the most highly sought-after skills in the technology world.

#### What we'll learn from this notebook

1. **Neural Networks** and **Deep Learning**. *We will learn how to build a Neural Network, including a deep neural network and how to train tem on data.*
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: **Hyperparameter tuning**, **Regularzation** and **Optimization**
3. Structuring our Machine Learnign project
4. Convolutional Neural Networks.*Convolutional Neural Networks. are often apply to images*
5. Natural Laguage Processing: Building **sequence models**.*How to apply them to nature laguage processing and other problems*
